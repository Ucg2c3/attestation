# Privacy Sandbox Enrollment Report

As part of the Privacy Sandbox Enrollment process, a list of enrolled registrants will be published. This list contains developers who have successfully completed the [enrollment process](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/relevance/enrollment) and have therefore been issued an Enrollment ID. This list will be updated on a monthly basis. 

For Android developers: the included Enrollment ID can be used in the app manifest to deny access to Privacy Sandbox APIs (PS APIs) from within your app for a specific company.

## FAQs

Q: Does this list contain developers who did not successfully complete the enrollment process?

A: No, only successful enrollments are listed here. 

Q: Why don’t you show the registrants who did not finish the process?

A: Submissions which do not result in a successful enrollment do not have access to the PS APIs and therefore will not be included in the Enrollment Report.

Q: Does inclusion on this report mean these enrollees are using the PS APIs?

A: No, enrollees on this list are successfully registered but this does not mean they are actively using the PS APIs.

Q: Does this list indicate the enrollee’s attestation file status?

A: No, these enrollees have only completed the enrollment process. They may or may not yet have completed the attestation requirement. The report may in the future include attestation status information. 

Q: If an enrollee fails to ever complete the attestation process, will they eventually be removed from this list?

A: Yes, if the attestation files do not remain valid, the enrollee would be removed from the list and unable to access the APIs. Enrollees have 30 days after successfully enrolling to complete the attestation process. 

Q: Are entities with multiple enrollments included in this report?

A: Yes, entities with multiple enrollments are listed and they are shown in alphabetical order by company name so they are naturally grouped together. 

Q: If an enrollee updates their Enrollment, will that be reflected in the report?

A: Yes, the next report would reflect any changes to an enrollee's enrollment. 

Q: Do Individual enrollments also appear on this list?

A: Yes, this list contains both individual and company enrollments.
